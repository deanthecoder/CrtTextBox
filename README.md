# CrtTextBox

**CrtTextBox** is an Avalonia C# project that enhances a standard TextBox control with a custom SKSL shader, giving it the appearance of an orange retro CRT screen. This effect adds a nostalgic touch to your UI with features like fish-eye distortion, scan lines, vignette, screen jitter, background noise, and a scrolling electron bar.
